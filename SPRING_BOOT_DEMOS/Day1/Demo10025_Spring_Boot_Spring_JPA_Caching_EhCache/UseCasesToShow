//use case1
// Perform GetAll operation multiple times
// show the translated queries. For First Time query is created
// tell them caches

// use case2:
// create a employee record, during creation we know it will be put up in the cache
// so if we try to retrieve it then, it will be retrieved from the cache not from the DB hence 
// hence will not show any select query for select operation

// use case3:
// create a record, --Put up in cache
// update a record, -- it will update the record in the cache as well when updated in DB
// now find the single record, --- it will get the updated data from cache without 
// hitting the db and retrieving the same from cache...


//usecase4:
// getall the results from the Database
// create one record and get details again and check.
// you will not get the new record inserted.. as values are returned from cache not from DB, check console no SQL,
// hence purge all the elements in the cache  and fetch again
// now you will see the elements getting fetched from Db and put up in the cache..
// this also shows that the cacheable annotation will not the update the cache unlike the caheput annotation,

//usecae5:
// evict annotation removes the data from cache on delete operations success
// so that the cached result should not be returned.
